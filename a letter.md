My children:

I have found your mother in thousands of people.

She is kind and clever.

She is the most lovely girl i have ever seen.

I will love her forever.



Your dad.




My children:

Your father is the one I have been looking for.

He is considerate and romantic. He satisfies all my fantasies about men.

I love him so much. I hope you can feel that as I do.

Your mum.
